Being a first-timer, contributing is awesome! :tada:

But, of course there are some contributing rules: Like how filling out the comment part or how to make an appropriate pull request.
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file helps you out.

Big projects have a big set of rules & regulations over how to contribute. But, since this project is for a first-timer, 
we will have as less rules as possible. :pizza:

- Write your guide only in Markdown format.
- Place your guide in an appropriate folder. Generally, the name of the folder can be taken from the label tag of the respective 
issue itself.
- If you are writing an article about which an issue has not been defined, you are free to do it!
- When making a PR, mention the issue you are solving or the name of the article.
- The maintainer will review your PR in an span of 2 days max.**Don't review other contributor's PR until said so by the maintainer
himself**.

**HAPPY CONTRIBUTING** :smile:
