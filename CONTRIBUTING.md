Contributing as a first-timer is awesome! :tada:

Of course, there are some contributing rules: such as how to fill out the comment part, or how to create a great Pull Request.

Big projects have a big set of rules and regulations on how to contribute. But, since this project is for first-timers, we will have as few rules as possible. :pizza:

- Create a fork of this repository.
- Write your guide in Markdown.
- Place your guide in a separate folder. Generally, you can use the name of the tag of the GitHub issue that got you started.
- If you are writing an article without a related issue, you are free to do it!
- When making a pull request, mention the issue you are solving or the name of the article.
- **Do not just COPY any article from Wikipedia/encyclopedia/book/blog**. It's usually quite easy to say whether you have written the article by yourself or copied it. And this is not the aim of this project. If an article is found to be copied, the maintainer will comment on it as 'copied'.
- While creating a PR, please follow the PR template guidelines.
- The maintainer will review your PR within 2 days. **Do not review other contributors' PRs until asked to by the maintainer**.

**Happy contributing!** :smile:
