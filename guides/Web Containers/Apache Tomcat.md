# Apache Tomcat

Apache Tomcat, often referred to as Tomcat Server,is a Java servlet container and a web server from the Apache Software Foundation(ASF).
It can be used standalone or it can be used behind traditional web servers such as Apache httpd.It uses the request/response message exchange pattern to serve web pages.
Tomcat basically implements the java servlet and the java server pages specifications from Sun Microsystems.It provides a pure java web server enviornment for java code to run in.

Apache Tomcat includes tools for configuaration and management.It can also be configured directly by editing xml configuration files.It is a cross platform software which works on various operating systems.Tomcat requires java version 1.6 although previous versions have java 1.1 through 1.5.

The Apache ant software tool for automating build process was developed as a side effect of the creation of tomcat as an open source project.
