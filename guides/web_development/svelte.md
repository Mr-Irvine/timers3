## WHAT EXACTLY SVELTE IS

svelte got popular around 2019 with it's latest svetle 3 release.
svelte is not a UI framework like angular or vue nor a library like UI react.Svelte is a compiler .svelte comes with itâ€™s own style, design pattern which is similar to vue.js design template.with svelte you write styles markup and instructions. after that when you build the production application , svelte take your code and make a bundle.js file and other instruction files which does not have any extra code that is injected like other react vue or angular do. That bundle.js will be then shipped and execute on runtime. Because of that ,svelte code is really small in size compared to others like react vue or angular.svelte have some interesting features that other competitors doesn't have.
