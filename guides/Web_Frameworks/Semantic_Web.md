# Introduction

The [**Semantic Web**][1] is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards by the [W3C][2]. The term was coined by [Tim Berners-Lee][3] for a web of data:

> "I have a dream for the Web become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A **Semantic Web**, which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The 'intelligent agents' people have touted for ages will finally materialize." - **Tim Berners-Lee**

## History of Web

- **Web 1.0 (Web of Documents)**: The great invention of the web is the hyperlink; clicking the link gets you to the next document in the chain.

- **Web 2.0 (Social Web)**: This web represents social stuff but do not interoperate because data aren't linked e.g. updating facebook profile doesn't affect you linkedin.

- **Web 3.0 (Web of Data)**: Semantic Web is not a seperate web but an extension of the current one that not only presents data but also und Here, it is all about connecting the data at lower levels not just documentserstand it.

## Semantic Web

###### What is Semantic?

Here, **Semantic** doesn't refer that computers are going to understand the meaning of anything, but that the logical pieces of meaning can be mechanically manipulated by a machine to useful ends. It can be implemented is expressed with the help of well suited knowledge representation aka **Ontologies**. In the same way that Web 1.0 abstracted away the network and physical layers, the Semantic Web abstracts away the document and application layers involved in the exchange of information.

###### Semantic Web consists of the following --

- **Data Model** : [Resource Description Framework][4] (RDF) is a flexible and abstract data modeling language which has more than one representation.

- **Query Language**: [SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language][5] (SPARQL) is the query language of the Semantic Web. It is specifically designed to query data across various systems.

- **Schema and Ontology Languages**: [Web Ontology Language][6] (OWL)  is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies i.e. shared concepualization. They enable you to define concepts composably so that these concepts can be reused as much and as often as possible.

###### Implementation

The term **semantic** technologies represents a diverse family of technologies that have been in existence for a long time and seek to help derive meaning from information. Some of the examples include -- **Natural-language processing**, **Auto-categorization**, **Sentiment Analysis**, **Summarization**, **Question Answering**, **Data Mining**, **Classification** & **Semantic Search**.
