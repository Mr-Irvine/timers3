# Apache Tomcat

## What is  Tomcat ?
If you are new to Java programming,you might have heard about Tomcat,but what exactly it means? After learning core Java if you want to go for enterprise world,if you want to work on websites or suppose you want to make your own web application using Java,then of course you have to work on servlets,but what is a servlet? If you are familiar with website or web world you must have heard about HTTP(hyper text transfer protocol) .If you want to provide any web service or if you want to provide any static content maybe using HTML or maybe you just want to send data from server to client,you need a server and that server is HTTP. So if you want to make a static website you need a HTTP server but to make it dynamic we need servlets. So we use HTTP only for fetching data but if you want to send a dynamic data then you need a servlet. Thus we need a HTTP server were you will run your servlets. So when you combine your HTTP server and servlet,they both combine to give you one server which is Tomcat.Tomcat is not the only server available in the market there are other servers available as well.Thus basically Tomcat is a HTTP server and a servlet container.Tomcat has got Apache license and is handled by Apache Software Foundation(ASF).

Tomcat is the result of an open collaboration of developers and is available from the Apache website in both binary and source versions.Tomcat can be used as either a standalone product with its own internal web server or together with other web servers, including Apache, Netscape Enterprise Server, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and Microsoft Personal Web Server. Tomcat requires a Java Runtime Enterprise Environment that conforms to JRE 1.1 or later.
