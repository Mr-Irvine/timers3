If you are working with Python and need database integration in your project, SQLAlchemy is a widely used and trusted tool for doing so. SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit which basically provides SQL functionality in **pythonic** code. 
You could always say why not write raw SQL queries as Python strings and work with those? Well, there are certain disadvantages to that approach. SQL queries with python strings could get really messy and that too, really quickly. 
SQLAlchemy has several advantages over this approach. It makes the code cleaner and more secure. Most importantly,
you can think of database structure in terms of objects and their attributes instead of the traditional columns and tables. 
With this, we can introduce the term ORM. SQLAlchemy is an ORM, namely an **Object Relational Mapper**. This means that this toolkit transfers *low level database logic* ( columns and tables ) into *higher level entities such as objects* which are more compliant with object oriented programming languages like Python or Java. 
This way when you get back a query result, you need not worry about working with columns or rows in the traditional way. Rather, that can be returned as a query *object* which will have certain properties and functions of its own like a normal object, which can be used to work with the query result in a manner we are much more familiar with.
