## What?

First-timers guide is a guide to encourage more people to venture into open source. The word "guide" can be a little misunderstood
here. It means articles written in Markdown, and covering various topics in Computer Science, ranging from time complexity to Word2Vec.
Literally **anyone** can contribute to the repository.

## How?

1. Write an article in Markdown about a topic you know. The article should be between 100-150 words and 
easy to read for a newbie.
2. Then create a pull request. :tada:

2. Add your article following the rules in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## FAQ

### Can I submit a code file in any programming language?

No. If it is *absolutely essential* you may talk about it to the owner and he will decide.

### I don't know a programming language. Can I contribute?

Absolutely yes. You don't require knowledge of any particular language. However, you must know about the subject of the article you are contributing.
